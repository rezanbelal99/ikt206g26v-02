    # We use the latest Ubuntu runner (Linux environment)
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    # Step 1: Check out the code from your repository so the runner can access it
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4

    # Step 2: Install .NET on the runner
    - name: Setup .NET
      uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v4
      with:
        dotnet-version: 8.0.x # Ensure this matches the version on your local machine (likely 8.0 or 9.0)

    # Step 3: Restore dependencies (nuget packages)
    - name: Restore dependencies
      run: dotnet restore

    # Step 4: Build the project
    # We use --no-restore because we already ran restore above
    - name: Build
      run: dotnet build --no-restore

    # Step 5: Run Tests
    # We use --no-build because we just built it in the previous step
    - name: Test
      run: dotnet test --no-build --verbosity normal
